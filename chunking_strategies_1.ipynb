We expect\\neveryone at ClearPeaks to be focused on a 100% quality service to maintain our brand and\\nreputation, whether at customer or internally.  \\n#### Integrity  \\nIt is vital that we are honest and transparent with our customers and colleagues, even if\\nsometimes it disappoints or impacts negatively on expectations.

But in the end, transparency is best.  \\n#### Mutual Respect  \\nFor colleagues’ opinions, race, colour, job level, personal choices etc – respect develops trust,\\nhealthy working relationships and contributes to a happy culture.  \\n#### Commitment  \\nWorking hard, diligently and focusing on getting the job done efficiently to make your project a\\nsuccess - more will come as a result.  \\n#### Human & Caring  \\nLet's keep our human spirit, as everyone deserves this, so let's make sure we do not discriminate\\nwith who gets our attention – everyone should be cared for.  \\n#### Innovation  \\nWe rely on all our employees to look for innovation take-aways in all we do – whether in\\ncustomer projects, internal objectives, or office admin areas. Looking for the best innovative and\\ncreative solution is what our customers look for in a niche service, so let’s deliver.\",\n",

Medical notes are expected where sickness extends more than 2\\nworkdays. These notes should be sent to the HR team (hr_team@clearpeaks.com) except in the\\ncase of employees working from Spain, whose medical center will directly notify ClearPeaks’ HR\\nteam.',\n",

       " '### Hybrid Working Model  \\nClearPeaks is taking on a hybrid working model policy. Daily attendance to office is voluntary,\\nhowever it is recommended that everyone works from the office once a week to preserve the\\nrelationship with your team and other colleagues, to take a chance to review specific topics, and\\nto maintain ClearPeaks team culture.  \\nAlong these lines, we encourage you to be present in person at the following times defined by\\nthe company:  \\n- Group Manager Delivery Meetings (monthly)\\n- Team Manager Delivery Meetings (twice a month)\\n- On-site trainings\\n- Corporate events\\n- Project needs\\n- When requested by the Manager  \\nBesides the office location, Work from Home (WFH) may be conducted from the address informed\\nto HR. An employee may also add a second WFH address in the same country of residence, which\\nshould also be informed to HR. This second address is understood as an additional stable place\\nfrom which you can work; and does not include sporadic and seasonal or similar places. Working\\nfrom your second address should not affect the attendance to office explained above, and needs\\nto be approved with your Team Manager and PM.  \\nBear in mind that if at any time these addresses may change, HR must be informed accordingly.  \\n#### Remote Work  \\nEmployees hired in locations more than 120km away from any ClearPeaks office are considered\\nfully remote.  \\nThe above recommendations for office attendance will not apply to this model of work. However,\\nsuch employees may be requested to visit any of the ClearPeaks offices for business matters. In\\nthose cases, the company will sponsor transportation (from the initial location to the office and\\nany transport required within the office’s city), meal allowances, and hotel if necessary. Corporate\\nTravel Policy guidelines apply in these cases.

If a consultant has had difficulty to consume their entire vacation allowance due to\\ncustomer project demands on billable projects. Non-billable project demands will not be\\nconsidered.\\n2. Exceptional, non-customer/project related carry-over vacation days will be honoured\\nonly if they have been approved by both your Team Manager and Operations manager\\nno later than September 1st of the active year. Exceptional carry-over days considered\\nwill be for example, to extend a honeymoon or to enjoy a well-in-advance planned long\\ntrip.\\n3.
